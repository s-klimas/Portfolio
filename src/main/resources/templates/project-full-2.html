                <div class="project-full-text">The idea for Coupon Calculator came about in a completely everyday
                    situation – while shopping online. I noticed that shopping apps, in my case SHEIN, automatically
                    suggest the most cost-effective coupon for the entire basket, but do not fully utilise the potential
                    of available discounts. It is often more advantageous to split the list of products into several
                    smaller orders and use more coupons. This idea became the starting point for creating an application
                    that automatically calculates the best combinations of products and coupons, allowing you to save
                    even more. The first version was created out of curiosity and a desire to see if it could be done
                    purely algorithmically. Initially, everything worked flawlessly – until we had to deal with a larger
                    data set, which revealed that the seemingly simple calculator turned out to be a <b>small
                        computational monster</b> in practice.

                <div class="project-full-description-header">
                    <div class="project-full-description-question">What is crucial in this project?</div>
                    <div class="project-full-description-answer">A solution to an unsolvable problem.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="project-full-text">Every possible combination of products and coupons meant that a huge
                    number of combinations had to be generated – exactly <b>2^n subsets of products</b>, each of which
                    had to be multiplied by the number of available coupons. This meant that with a list of 16 products
                    sent by my girlfriend, the number of combinations exceeded the capabilities of modern computers. It
                    was then that I realised that the problem was not in my code (at least not only), but in the very
                    nature of the task. And so began the second iteration of the project, whose main goal was to <b>optimise
                        performance</b>. The solution turned out to be the use of <b>heuristic algorithms</b>, which,
                    instead of searching for the absolute best solution, allow you to find a solution that is ‘good
                    enough’ but achievable in a reasonable amount of time. In short - large data sets are divided into
                    smaller batches, the size of which is controlled by configuration variables, making it possible to
                    maintain a balance between accuracy and performance.

                <div class="project-full-description-header">
                    <div class="project-full-description-question">What did I learn from this project?</div>

                </div>
                <div class="project-full-text">Today, Coupon Calculator is not only an example of <b>successful
                    optimisation</b>, but also proof of how a practical problem can become the starting point for an<b>ambitious
                    engineering project</b>. The application shows how the art of compromise between precision and
                    performance can translate into practical benefits — in this case, saving the user money and time. It
                    is also a story about how <b>curiosity</b>, <b>observation</b> and the desire to solve an everyday
                    problem can turn into a project with a solid engineering background and potential for further
                    development. Coupon Calculator has thus become not only a <b>technical exercise</b>, but also a <b>story</b>
                    about the pursuit of efficiency, learning through experimentation, and combining theoretical
                    knowledge with practical application in the everyday world.
