                </div>
                <div class="project-full-text">The origin of this project stemmed from a very practical need - I wanted
                    to find an effective way to <b>present myself</b> as a programmer. While browsing job offers, I
                    noticed that a GitHub portfolio alone is often not enough to stand out from other candidates. So I
                    wanted to create a space where I could not only show my code, but also talk about my <b>career
                        path</b>, <b>projects</b> and <b>motivations</b>. Initially, I considered ready-made solutions
                    such as WordPress, but I quickly realised that this was a great opportunity to develop my skills in
                    the field of <b>application deployment</b>. This is how the idea of creating my own website was born
                    - a project that not only presented my profile, but also served as a field for learning and
                    experimentation.

                    <div class="project-full-description-question">What was the hardest part?</div>
                    <div class="project-full-description-answer">Deployment, and since I'm a backend developer -
                        frontend.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="project-full-text">Understanding and mastering deployment - from creating an image to
                    running it on a remote server - proved particularly difficult. On the other hand, the front-end part
                    of the project required me to understand the principles of modern interface design. To this end, I
                    turned to <b>Figma</b>, which became my primary tool for prototyping and planning the website's
                    appearance. Thanks to it, I was able to precisely plan each element of the layout, and then use it
                    as a basis for creating a modern website.

                    <div class="project-full-description-answer">Representation of who I am.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="project-full-text">Today, this project serves a much broader function than just a
                    portfolio—it is a personal story of my development, learning, and consistency in pursuing my goals.
                    It shows, once again, how a simple idea can be turned into something functional. The website not
                    only presents me as a person, but also proves that I am capable of <b>independently planning</b>,
                    <b>designing</b>, and <b>implementing a fully functional system</b>. The value of this project lies
                    in the combination of aesthetics and technology - on the user side, we get an intuitive, modern
                    showcase, and on the programming side, well-organized code based on proven tools. It is this balance
                    between form and content that makes the project more than just a website for me - it is proof that
                    every line of code can be part of a bigger story about passion, determination, and development.
